OVERVIEW:

Here is a brief description of how to compile Pragha to Windows using MinGW
from an Fedora host system. Note that these were my tests. Surely there are
better ways of doing it. In any case send me a mail.

Install deps: [1]
	# sudo yum install mingw32-gcc mingw32-gtk3 mingw32-gstreamer1 mingw32-gstreamer1-plugins-base mingw32-sqlite mingw32-taglib

Prepare the build:
	# git clone https://github.com/matiasdelellis/pragha.git PraghaWin32
	# cd PraghaWin32
	# ./autogen.sh --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-debug
	# mingw32-configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-debug

Build and install:
	# make -j5
	# sudo make install

How to test:
	# sudo yum install wine
	# wine /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/pragha.exe

It work properly?
	Probably not, due to lack the support to directsound, and all proprietary
	codecs.
	You need install a complete version of Gstreamer SDK
	* Download: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.2.4.1/gstreamer-1.0-x86-1.2.4.1.msi
	* Install it, and continue with the next section.

How to construct the installer:
	* Download Inno Setup QuickStart Pack from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
	(If you have little space, be careful. Of all optional dependencies, you
	just need the Ide.)
	* Launch Inno Script Studio.
	* Open the script file pragha\win32\inno-setup.iss
	 - The script uses the oxygen icons. Change it setting the variable "ICON_PATH"
	 - If you installed Gstreamer SDK on another folder, adjust the variable "GST_CODECS"
	* Compile with: Menu->Project->Compile
	* Test with: Menu->Debug->Launch
	* The distributable installer is PraghaWin32/win32/Pragha 1.3.0.exe

Note:
[1] Optionally you can add a repository, that improves the appearance of Gtk3 in
windows. Theme updated from git, enable Cleartype in fonts, etc.
